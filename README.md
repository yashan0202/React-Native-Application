<h1>React Native Application End-to-End Testing with Maestro</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This repository contains an example <strong>React Native application</strong> paired with comprehensive <strong>end-to-end tests</strong> written using <strong>Maestro</strong>. The project showcases how to set up an environment, generate a React Native application, and write effective tests to ensure the application works as intended. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Detailed documentation for the project is provided in a PDF file named <strong>Midas Lab (Yash Anand).pdf</strong>, which is attached to the repository for reference.
    </p>

  <h2>Steps to Implement</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Generate the React Native Application</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Visit the <a href="https://github.com/infinitered/ignite" target="_blank">Ignite GitHub repository</a>.</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions to install the Ignite CLI.</li>
        <li>Use the Ignite boilerplate to generate a new React Native application with the following command:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
npx ignite-cli new MyReactNativeApp
    </pre>
    <h3>Step 2: Set Up the Environment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure the <strong>React Native development environment</strong> is properly set up on your machine.</li>
        <li>Install Maestro and any other necessary dependencies for testing:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
npm install -g @maestro/testing
    </pre>
    <h3>Step 3: Write Maestro Tests</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Familiarize yourself with <strong>Maestroâ€™s syntax</strong> and features.</li>
        <li>Identify key functionalities in the application that need testing.</li>
        <li>Write end-to-end tests using Maestro, covering different scenarios and features of the application.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example Maestro test:</p>
    <pre>
import { test, expect } from '@maestro/testing';
import App from './App';

test('renders app correctly', async () => {
    const { getByText } = render(&lt;App /&gt;);
    const textElement = getByText(/Hello, World!/i);
    expect(textElement).toBeTruthy();
});
    </pre>
